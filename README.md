Oh man. Just stumbled outta that theater, feeling like I just got off a rickety roller coaster. Bring Her Back, dude. Wild ride. Still hear the popcorn crunching under my feet, and I think some got stuck on my shoe or was it in my hair? Whatever.

Right, the  . Where to even begin... There's that scene, you know? The one with the dog—didn't expect to tear up. Felt like my heart was getting twisted like a balloon animal. It reminded me of that time in high school when we tried to fit a mattress in Derek’s mustang. Doesn't make sense, I know.

> But the noisy theater though! Couldn't hear some of the lines. That bass was shaking my spine, like my old car speakers when they short-circuited... the kind of things that make your bones vibrate in your skin. Was kind of perfect for that chase scene tho. Man, I should just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it at home with better sound...

Are. You. Kidding. Me. That twist though, like a roundhouse kick to the face but softer because you're still gripping that empty soda cup, anticipation bubbles up like soda fizz. Gave me those chills. The villain's monologue was oddly reminiscent of my uncle ranting about fishing permits—nonsensical but somehow mesmerizing, you know what I mean?

Oh, right—Gladys, my back's killing me! Those seats, made me feel like I’ve aged faster than a fruit fly's lifespan. And then that final scene! Left me more confused than when Gary tried explaining multi-level marketing schemes. The entire plot felt like untangling a bundle of headphones in the dark... but sorta satisfying?

Better not forget to let Jack know he should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if he misses this one in theaters. Save some back pain. Have a proper setup at home. 

Wasn't all perfect though, stumbled a bit near the middle—more like they misplaced a jigsaw piece. Left it on a park bench or on the subway. Or maybe it fell into a cereal box? Kind of miss the days when things were done presto, not this mind-bending loop-de-loop stuff.

Here's where it gets really interesting. In the middle of it all, this moment, man... felt like the beginning was the end was the beginning, in a way. I swear, they’re threading in loops like an amateur knitter's first scarf. And the music? Not my style, but it grew on me like mold on forgotten bread.

Okay, I've rambled enough. Gotta rest my achy back. Theater floors shouldn’t be sticky in 2023. Are we regressing or something?
